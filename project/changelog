V.1.0 - 2022-10-23
- Release accepted  
Doc:
+ Updated doxygen documentation with version 1.2
+ Added documentation "Configuration menu" with version 1.0

V.1.0-RC5 - 2022-10-23
Common:
+ Minimal length of recognized LIN break is increased to 12 bits in algorithm of Sniffer RS-232 (more stability in detection)  
Bug fixe(s):
+ Timer TIM6 is replaced with TIM5 with 32-bit counter (it lets recognize LIN break with low UART speed)

V.1.0-RC4 - 2022-10-23
Doc:
+ Added doxygen documentation v.1.1 for the project  
Bug fixe(s):
+ Fixed BSP UART driver to read 9-bit data or data with parity bit from RS-232 channels
+ Added workaround into BSP UART IRQ handler if UART error occurred before DMA receiver is enabled
+ Fixed display of LIN support in case of not presettings
+ Added entry to upper menu "Algorithm" from menu item "Defaults->YES"

V.1.0-RC3 - 2022-10-13
New feature(s):
+ #11: LIN Support
  - added support of LIN protocol to the algorithm and UART presetting
  - corrected BSP UART to LIN support
+ #12: Implement HardFault and other fault handlers

V.1.0-RC2 - 2022-10-10
New feature(s):
+ Extended BSP UART API with "bsp_uart_is_started()"
+ Added display of firmware version  
Bug fixe(s):
+ Fixed API "cli_welcome()"
